# Unexpected Error with reduce() on Empty Iterable in Dart

This example demonstrates a common error that occurs when using the `reduce()` method in Dart with an empty iterable. The `reduce()` function requires at least one element in the iterable; otherwise, it throws a `StateError`. This is particularly relevant when combined with filtering operations like `where()`, which might not always find matching elements. The code below illustrates this behavior and shows how to handle this situation gracefully.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Run the `bug.dart` file.
2. Observe that if there are no even numbers in the list, a `StateError` is thrown.
